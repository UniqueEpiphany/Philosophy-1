# Determinism, Freedom, and Moral Reponsibility.

Determinism is the theory that everything in the universe is governed by cause and effect laws. 

Although we usually accept determinism in our practical activities, most of us also indulge in judgements of moral responsibility, which seems could never be justified, if determiminism is true. Since, according to determinism, everything people do is completely caused;  nothing could happen except what actually does happen. It seems to follow that nobody can ever act differently from the way he acts, and hence that freedom of action must be an illusion and that human beings are never properly accountable for their conduct. Alternatively, if freedom is not an illusion, then determinism must be false. 

Similar sentiments are expressesd by Mark Twain in his book "Reflections on Religion:

*Man is not blame for what he is. He didn't make himself. He has no control over himself. All the control is vested in his temperament - which he did not create - and in the circumstances which hedge  him round from the crade to the grave and which he did not devise...he is purely a piece of automatica mechanism as is a watch, and  can no more dictate or influence his actions than can the watch. he is a subject of pity, not blame - and not contempt. He is flung head over heels into this world without ever a chance to decline....*

When determinism is stated in this way it appears as a paralyszing doctorine which implies that human effort itself is pointless. For I can ask "What point is there to my mental struggle tonight, for whether i continue or give up is predetermined." Yet this seems absurb as well. Imagine a person falls off a ship, according to the determinism, it is senseless for him to make any attempt to be saved. For he is either fated to drown or else fated to be saved. This is the position of fatalism.  

However, it is possible to create an alternative line of argument, that our actions create the cause. That is the man is saved *because of his efforts* - because, for instance,  others may hear his cries. The fact that his efforts are themselves  caused in no way cancels outs the fact that the efforts were the cuase of his rescue. According to this view, all human actions are in principle *predictible*.
