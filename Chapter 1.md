# Determinism, Freedom, and Moral Reponsibility.

Determinism is the theory that everything in the universe is governed by cause and effect laws. 

Although we usually accept determinism in our practical activities, the vast majority of poeple also indulge in judgements of moral responsbility, which seems could never be justified, if determiminism is true. Under determinism, since everything people do is completely caused; and given the causal relationships in any particular case, nothing could happen except what actually does happen. It seems to follow that nobody can ever act differently from the way he acts, and hence that freedom must be an illusion and that human beings are never properly accountable for their conduct. Alternatively, if freedom is not an illusion, determinism  must be false.

When determinism is stated in this way it appears as a paralyszing doctorine which implies that human effort itself is pointless. For I can ask "What point is there to my mental struggle tonight, for whether i continue or give up is predetermined"
