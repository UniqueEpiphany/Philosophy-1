# Determinism, Freedom, and Moral Reponsibility.

Determinism is the theory that everything in the universe is governed by cause and effect laws. 

Although we usually accept determinism in our practical activities, the vast majority of poeple also indulge in judgements of moral responsbility, which seems could never be justified, if determiminism is true. Since everything people do is completely caused; and given the causal antecedents in any particular case, nothing could happen except wht adoes happen. It seems to follow taht nobably can ever act differently fron the way he acts, and hence that freedom must be an illusion and that hman beings are never properly accountable for their conduct. Alternatively, if freedom is not an illusion, determinism  must be false.
