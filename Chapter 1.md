# Determinism, Freedom, and Moral Reponsibility.

Determinism is the theory that everything in the universe is governed by cause and effect laws. 

Although we usually accept determinism in our practical activities, the vast majority of poeple also indulge in judgements of moral responsbility, which seems could never be justified, if determiminism is true. Under determinism, since everything people do is completely caused; and given the causal relationships in any particular case, nothing could happen except what actually does happen. It seems to follow that nobody can ever act differently from the way he acts, and hence that freedom must be an illusion and that human beings are never properly accountable for their conduct. Alternatively, if freedom is not an illusion, determinism  must be false. 

Similar sentiments are expressesd by Mark Twain in his book "Reflections on Religion:

*Man is not blame for what he is. He didn't make himself. He has no control over himself. All the control is vested in his temperament - which he did not create - and in the circumstances which hedge  him round from the crade to the grave and which he did not devise...he is purely a piece of autoamtica mechanims as is a watch, and  can no more dictate or influence his actions tahn can the watch. he is a subject of pity, not blame - and not contempt. He is flung head over heels into this world without ever a chance to decline....*

When determinism is stated in this way it appears as a paralyszing doctorine which implies that human effort itself is pointless. For I can ask "What point is there to my mental struggle tonight, for whether i continue or give up is predetermined."
